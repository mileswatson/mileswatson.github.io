                    <h2>GCSE NEA</h2>
                    <p>
                        For my GCSE non-examined assessment, I decided to make a simple card game
                        using the Appjar python library. The program allowed multiple users to create
                        local accounts, which were stored securely in an SQLite database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the GUI was fairly simple, the majority of the process was focussed on 
                        the development process, including thorough documentation and testing. The source 
                        code, along with documentation in MSWord, can be found
                        <a href='https://github.com/mileswatson/python-card-game'>here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>A-Level NEA</h2>
                    <p>
                        For my NEA, it is most likely that I will work on creating a decentralized
                        network, nicknamed "Hosta".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The network should have features that enable it
                        to be used as a social media, cryptocurrency, processing-power-for-rent platform,
                        as well as a secure file backup utility. The value of the cryptocoin should be kept
                        mostly stable, as it is linked to the value of data storage and processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although it is still very much a work in progress, the current source code can be
                        found <a href='https://github.com/mileswatson/hosta'>here</a>.
