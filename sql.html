                    <h2>What are databases?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A database is a collection of data organized in tables, stored and 
                        accessed by computer systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each table contains rows and columns, which are know as records and 
                        fields respectively.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Functionality</h2>
                    <p>
                        Databases all have the following basic functionality - create, read,
                        update, delete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each operation on a database (transaction) must satisfy ACID criteria.
                        This means that each transaction must succeed or fail as a complete unit, 
                        without partially completing an operation. ACID stands for:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Atomicity - a change to a database is either completely performed,
                                or not at all. A half completed change must not be saved to the 
                                database.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Consistency - any change in the database must retain the overall ]
                                state of a database. For example, money subtracted from one account 
                                must be added to another account, or the money will literally 
                                dissappear.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Isolation - a transaction must not be able to unterrupted by another
                                transaction, preventing race conditions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Durability - once a change has been made to a database, it must not
                                be lost due to a system failure.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
